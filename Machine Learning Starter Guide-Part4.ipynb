    "2. From a model perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a data perspective we would ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Could we collect more data? In machine learning, more data is generally better, as it gives a model more opportunities to learn patterns.\n",
    "* Could we improve our data? This could mean filling in missing values or finding a better encoding (turning data into numbers) strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a model perspective we would ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is there a better model we could use? if you've started out with a simple model, could you use a more complex one?(we saw an example of this when looking at the [Scikit-Learn machine learning map](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/machine_learning_map.html), ensemble methods are generally considered more complex models)\n",
    "* Could we improve the current model? If the model you're using performs well straight out of the box, can the hyperparameters be tuned to make it even better?\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Note:** Patterns in data are also often referred to as data parameters.
